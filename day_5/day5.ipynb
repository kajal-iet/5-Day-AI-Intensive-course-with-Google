    "-RemoteA2aAgent sends HTTP POST requests to the /tasks endpoint on http://localhost:8001\n",
    "-Request and response data follow the A2A Protocol Specification\n",

    "-The protocol ensures any A2A-compatible agent (regardless of language/framework) can communicate\n",
    "\n",
    "This standardization is what makes cross-organization, cross-language agent communication possible!\n",
    "\n",
    "What happened:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Customer asked about the iPhone 15 Pro\n",
    "2.Customer Support Agent (LlmAgent) received the question and decided it needs product information\n",
    "3.Support Agent delegated to the product_catalog_agent sub-agent\n",
    "4.RemoteA2aAgent (client-side proxy) translated this into an A2A protocol request\n",
    "5.The A2A request was sent over HTTP to http://localhost:8001 (highlighted in yellow)\n",
    "6.Product Catalog Agent (server) received the request and called get_product_info(\"iPhone 15 Pro\")\n",
    "7.Product Catalog Agent returned the product information via A2A response\n",
    "8.moteA2aAgent received the response and passed it back to the Support Agent\n",
    "9.pport Agent formulated a final answer with the product details\n",
    "10.Customer received the complete, helpful response\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Benefits Demonstrated\n",
    "1.Transparency: Support Agent doesn't \"know\" Product Catalog Agent is remote\n",
    "2.Standard Protocol: Uses A2A standard - any A2A-compatible agent works\n",
    "3.Easy Integration: Just one line: sub_agents=[remote_product_catalog_agent]\n",

    "-Third-party Integration: Consume agents from external vendors (e.g., product catalogs, payment processors)\n",
    "-Cross-language: Product Catalog Agent could be Java, Support Agent Python\n",
    "-Specialized Teams: Vendor maintains catalog, your team maintains support agent\n",
    "-Cross-Organization: Vendor hosts catalog on their infrastructure, you integrate via A2A\n"
