    "📦 Session\n",
    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a single, continuous conversation. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ADK, a Session is comprised of two key components Events and State:\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 Session.Events:\n",
    "\n",
    "While a session is a container for conversations, Events are the building blocks of a conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Events:\n",
    "\n",
    "User Input: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "Agent Response: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "Tool Call: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",
    "Tool Output: The data returned from a tool call, which the agent uses to continue its reasoning\n",
    "{} Session.State:\n",
    "\n",
    "session.state is the Agent's scratchpad, where it stores and updates dynamic details needed during the conversation. Think of it as a global {key, value} pair storage which is available to all subagents and tools."

Before AI, identifying a new biological target for a disease was often a painstaking, hypothesis-driven process that could take years, if not decades. AI is dramatically changing this by:\\\\n\\\\n**What is a \\\\\"Target\\\\\" in Drug Discovery?**\\\\n\\\\nA drug target is typically a molecule (like a protein or a gene) within the body that is involved in a disease. By designing a drug that interacts with this target \\\\u2013 either to activate it, inhibit it, or modify its function \\\\u2013 scientists aim to treat or prevent the disease.\\\\n\\\\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification:**\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Analyzing Massive and Diverse Datasets:** AI excels at sifting through colossal amounts of data that are far too complex for humans to process manually.

      "\n",
      "**AI for Target Identification & Validation**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a critical and incredibly powerful application of AI in drug discovery. Before AI, identifying a new biological target for a disease was often a painstaking, hypothesis-driven process that could take years, if not decades. AI is dramatically changing this by:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is a \"Target\" in Drug Discovery?**\n",
      "\n",
      "A drug target is typically a molecule (like a protein or a gene) within the body that is involved in a disease. By designing a drug that interacts with this target – either to activate it, inhibit it, or modify its function – scientists aim to treat or prevent the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Analyzing Massive and Diverse Datasets:** AI excels at sifting through colossal amounts of data that are far too complex for humans to process manually. This includes:\n",
      "    *   **Genomic Data:** DNA sequences, gene expression levels (how active genes are).\n",
      "    *   **Proteomic Data:** The types and amounts of proteins present in cells or tissues.\n",
      "    *   **Transcriptomic Data:** RNA sequences, which indicate gene activity.\n",
      "    *   **Clinical Data:** Patient health records, symptoms, treatment outcomes, genetic predispositions.\n",
      "    *   **Literature and Patents:** Vast databases of scientific publications and patent filings.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Identifying Novel Disease Signatures:** AI algorithms can detect subtle patterns and correlations within these datasets that indicate which biological pathways or molecules are uniquely associated with a disease state.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** An AI might find that a specific protein is consistently overexpressed in tumor cells compared to healthy cells, and that this protein plays a key role in tumor growth and survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Uncovering \"Undruggable\" Targets:** Many diseases are driven by targets that have historically been considered difficult or impossible to drug with traditional small molecules or antibodies. AI can help:\n",
      "    *   **Understand the intricate biology:** By mapping complex protein-protein interactions or cellular signaling cascades, AI can reveal new ways to modulate these targets.\n",
      "    *   **Identify novel therapeutic modalities:** AI might suggest that a gene therapy or RNA-based therapeutic would be more suitable for a particular target than a conventional small molecule.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Validating Potential Targets:** Once a potential target is identified, AI can help validate its role in the disease.\n",
      "    *   **Predicting \"Druggability\":** AI models can assess how likely it is that a drug molecule can be designed to effectively interact with the identified target.\n",
      "    *   **Simulating Biological Systems:** AI can simulate how altering the activity of a target might impact other biological processes, helping to predict potential side effects or downstream consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Accelerating Hypothesis Generation:** Instead of researchers spending months or years forming hypotheses, AI can rapidly generate multiple plausible hypotheses about disease mechanisms and potential targets, which researchers can then experimentally test.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Benefits of AI in Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Speed:** Significantly reduces the time it takes to identify promising new drug targets.\n",
      "*   **Novelty:** Uncovers targets and disease mechanisms that might have been missed by human researchers.\n",
      "*   **Efficiency:** Helps prioritize which targets are most likely to lead to successful drugs, saving R&D resources.\n",
      "*   **Broader Scope:** Enables exploration of a wider range of disease areas and biological complexities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Companies and Examples:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Many companies are at the forefront of this:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Uses AI to analyze biological images from cellular experiments to map disease biology and identify targets.\n",

      "*   **BenevolentAI:** Applies AI to analyze scientific literature and biomedical data to discover new drug targets and insights into diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, AI is acting as a super-powered microscope and analytical engine, allowing scientists to see and understand the intricate biological underpinnings of diseases in ways that were previously impossible, thereby paving the way for entirely new classes of medicines.\n",

    "6.1 Callbacks\n",
    "ADK's callback system lets you hook into key execution moments. Callbacks are Python functions you define and attach to agents - ADK automatically calls them at specific stages, acting like checkpoints during the agent's execution flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of callbacks as event listeners in your agent's lifecycle. When an agent processes a request, it goes through multiple stages: receiving the input, calling the LLM, invoking tools, and generating the response. Callbacks let you insert custom logic at each of these stages without modifying the core agent code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Available callback types:\n",
    "\n",
    "before_agent_callback → Runs before agent starts processing a request\n",
    "after_agent_callback → Runs after agent completes its turn\n",
    "before_tool_callback / after_tool_callback → Around tool invocations\n",
    "before_model_callback / after_model_callback → Around LLM calls\n",
    "on_model_error_callback → When errors occur\n",
    "Common use cases:\n",

    "For automatic memory storage, we'll use after_agent_callback. This function triggers every time the agent finishes a turn, then calls add_session_to_memory() to persist the conversation automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here's the challenge: how does our callback function actually access the memory service and current session? That's where callback_context comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define a callback function, ADK automatically passes a special parameter called callback_context to it. The callback_context provides access to the Memory Service and other runtime components.\n",

    "How we'll use it: In our callback, we'll access the memory service and current session to automatically save conversation data after each turn.\n",
    "\n",
